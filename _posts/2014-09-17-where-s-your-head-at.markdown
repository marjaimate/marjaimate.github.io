There are times when you are so involved in something, you know you're about to make a breakthrough with that bug/code that you've been working on for hours/days/weeks. And then. Nothing. You are still at your desk, in front of you computer X hours later. And no joy. "Just one more hour and I'll crack this" - a lie I've often told myself before, only to realise later what I actually needed is a break.

It's like a mini-holiday. A break to remove youreself from the problem for a brisk walk outside, or just go home and spend some time with your family. And the next time you pick up the problem the solution will come you. It's all natural I think. I've seen something similar with my son watching him in his first weeks in montessori. The first 4 weeks were overwhelming for him, he couldn't process all the information, names, expressions. Then there was a 2 weeks mid-term break. After the first week he started to recall more and more from those sessions. His mind was given some processing time, time to reflect on all he's experienced.

This is something our adult minds need as well. Don't listen to the false heroics of the "pulling an nighter", "I've worked till midnight". The next day your focus will be worse then ever due to lack of sleep, and overwhelming your mind with problems. Rest when you're tired, take your break during the day as well. A 20 minute walk outside can do wonders after lunch.
