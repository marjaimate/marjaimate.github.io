    I am a delivery and product focused software engineer working with industry leading companies as well as startups. Team player on all levels, love creating great products that many people use day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
    My most recent endeavour was with SumUp delivering the initial product to launch the company into the public and in quick succession expand our foothold in 6 additional countries. Lead the team who delivered our state-of-the-art Chip+PIN solution, the Pin+ and helped the whole company to meet regulatory needs both on business and software level with FCA, PCI, and major card schemes.
