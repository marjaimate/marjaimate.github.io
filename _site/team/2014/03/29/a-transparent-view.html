          <h2>A transparent view</h2>

<p>I have worked with a lot of different team setups. Started off being the only Junior member in a team of 7, working alone in a project, doing prototypes as part of a 3-men team and leading a group of 10+ engineers to deliver a startup launch. All these experiences have tought me a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value your people, those are the best assets you can have</li>
<li>Be honest, always provide a fully transparent view</li>
<li>Engineers are never ready</li>
<li>When you treat people with respect and trust, they will flourish</li>
</ul>

<p>My recent journey as part of SumUp have shown me how important transparency is. When you give context to the engineering team(s) they will deliver a much better end product. When you provide a helicopter view to your technical team, how do you expect them to understand the problem domain? Or to choose the correct tech to use?</p>

<p>When there is no full understanding between your business and tech ends, how can you expect to have believable estimates? Or a solution that is close to where the business wanted to be?</p>

<p>Being honest to your team - and to higher up the ranks too! - creates trust between you and your team. It helps setting expectations to the business and of course you and your team will avoid those last minute surprises of &#39;god, we are late again&#39; or &#39;we need one more week&#39;. Of course that one more week can last for the next 3 months. Honesty will create an atmosphere within your team that will encourage the same behaviour in every aspects of the software delivery. Engineers will give you their honest feelings and estimates, and not +40% (I know, been there, done that). You will also hear earlier when problems arise. When there&#39;s trust in the team, covering up an error is not acceptable. Start today, there&#39;s never to late to do so. Be the first to share all what you know and see how transparency can transform your team spirit with the matter of days.</p>
