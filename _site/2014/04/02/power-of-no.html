          <h2>Power of no</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Apr 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I am an Engineer. A very lazy one for that matter. I love when I can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get away with 0 coding and still solve a business problem</li>
  <li>Argue against making a code change where possible</li>
  <li>Deleting code, preferably lots</li>
  <li>Say no to requests</li>
</ul>

<p>Saying <em>no</em> 90% of the time is better than <em>yes</em> 100% the time. When you say <em>yes</em> to every single request project managers/CEOs/Investors ask for you will end up disappointing them, and yourself. Saying <em>yes</em> for everything will mean that you over-commit and ending up delivering much less like you intended. I also understand the human nature of ‘I want to help’. When you appear like a workaholic and take on everything - people will take that for granted. Most likely you will be the ‘goto guy’ for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>When you say <em>no</em> that doesn’t mean that you are not commited to your colleagues, company. It is actually the contrary - you are showing respect because you only take on what you think you can deliver. Delivering small pieces in quick succession with the right priority set will mean that you will have to bounce off a lot of these random requests. It also means that you are winning constantly: delivering value to the product and business while keeping yourself happy with those little wins! And that’s what really matters, creating and enhancing products. And you’ll see, all those requests that you rejected will turn out to be less important than they appeared at first glance.</p>
