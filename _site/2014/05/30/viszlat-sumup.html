<div class="post">
<p>First of all I would like to thank the founders for this interesting journey that SumUp was for the past 2.5 years for me. I learnt a lot throughout my time about software, startups, and most importantly people.</p>

<p>Dublin was the place where things were happening. This was the place where after a lot of blood and tears the Dublin team lifted the company off the grounds in 2012 August. The place where we all worked tirelessly to get our financial licence. The place where we helped each other out in the office as well as in all other SumUp locations. We were always there at the other end of the line. The place where many of us put in so many effort into the Holy Grail of SumUp, Pin+. The place where this group of people created an amazing atmosphere. An atmosphere where in the middle of the biggest storm you could walk in and enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>I am very grateful that I was part of this journey and I hope I managed to make my mark and enhance the ‘SumUp experience’ for the better.</p>

<p>Since the news about the closure of the Dublin office broke, all I could think of: this is it for me. I signed up initially for SumUp to see how a company starts, forms, evolves over the years. I experienced all that first hand and much more.</p>

<p>I wish every one of you luck in the future and hope SumUp excels for the years to come.</p>
