<p>My team is SumUp Dublin. And I have a huge <em>RESPECT</em> to every single one of them. Just a few nights ago the company announced that for various reasons they will shut down their Dublin operations. This was a major blow for everyone, as we always knew and kinda felt that this is the place where things were happening for SumUp.</p>

<p>This is the place where I was hired for. The place where <em>we lifted the company off the ground</em>. The place where we’ve delivered most of the mission critical product for SumUp. The place where with a help of many amazing people together we’ve managed to create an atmosphere second-to-none I ever experienced in my professional life. A team of people who pulled together in good and bad times. The most saddening thing of all to see all this vanishing within a few weeks. Nevertheless I know that we will keep in touch whether we go in separate ways, or manage to group up again with some.</p>

<p>There is a sense of camaraderie even in this tough times. When our founders broke the news everyone stood there with a straight face, accepted the decision. And we all agreed to solve this together, help each other out as much as we can with recommendations, create opportunities for each other as we all know one another well.</p>

<p>SumUp Dublin: I salute you and I am grateful that I was part of this group. Hope we will have a chance to work together again.</p>
