<p>There are times when you are so involved in something, you know you&#39;re about to make a breakthrough with that bug/code that you&#39;ve been working on for hours/days/weeks. And then. Nothing. You are still at your desk, in front of you computer X hours later. And no joy. &quot;Just one more hour and I&#39;ll crack this&quot; - a lie I&#39;ve often told myself before, only to realise later what I actually needed is a break.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a mini-holiday. A break to remove youreself from the problem for a brisk walk outside, or just go home and spend some time with your family. And the next time you pick up the problem the solution will come you. It&#39;s all natural I think. I&#39;ve seen something similar with my son watching him in his first weeks in montessori. The first 4 weeks were overwhelming for him, he couldn&#39;t process all the information, names, expressions. Then there was a 2 weeks mid-term break. After the first week he started to recall more and more from those sessions. His mind was given some processing time, time to reflect on all he&#39;s experienced.</p>

<p>This is something our adult minds need as well. Don&#39;t listen to the false heroics of the &quot;pulling an nighter&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ve worked till midnight&quot;. The next day your focus will be worse then ever due to lack of sleep, and overwhelming your mind with problems. Rest when you&#39;re tired, take your break during the day as well. A 20 minute walk outside can do wonders after lunch.</p>
