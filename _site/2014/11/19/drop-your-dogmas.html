<p>I’ve overheard a conversation that happened earlier today. Not that I was eavesdropping, I was just sitting in the middle of a co-working startuppy place with lots of people around. In front of me sat a guy, sounded and acted like a senior developer. A young titan entered the room and they immediataly started discussing a solution. The junior there gone into his explanation about a solution he thought of and coded already in C++ (fair play to him). Not even allowing to finish his first sentence the senior guy cut in and claimed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t like C++, I like Java. Do it in Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kid went on nevertheless explaining how he benchmarked and proved that his bit of code is faster than it would be done in Java. The senior’s response was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like Java because everything is easy and simple in Java, and it runs everywhere. Now go and do it in Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great example on how to kill a young and upcoming kid’s enthusiasm for programming. Poor guy seemed beaming with delight that he actually solved something! Yet his peer did shut him out on the basis of a one sided tech-view. Also he shut out even the possibility of listening or - god forbid - look at the code.</p>

<p>I personally don’t believe in dogmatic views when it comes to tech. Programming languages are tools to use and solve problems. The more tools you can use, the better solutions you’re gooing to write! I recently learnt Erlang and tought me a good deal about a different way of approaching problems in general. It doesn’t mean that I’d immediately jump in and solve something in it but would seriously consider it if Erlang is what suits a solution best. Don’t get me wrong, specialists have their time and place, and are very useful at times. But when it comes to building your product from scratch or even just throwing together ideas I think you should take the generalist approach. And always seek and hear out second opinions.</p>

<p>Young kid with the CoderDojo stickers on your laptop: Please go on, challenge that guy all day every day! Keep going and don’t let this turn you away from looking outside the box. If he doesn’t listen, there are plenty of other people and companies around who would like to have someone on board with that attitude.</p>
