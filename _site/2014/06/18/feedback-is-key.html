          <h2>Feedback is key</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I’ve been doing quiet a few interviews in the past 4-6 weeks. Been through a lot of tech tests that I failed, passed, excelled at. Talked to people that I would have loved to work with but they thought otherwise. And the other end as well where some people wanted me but I didn’t feel like going. I even turned down a very promising opportunity just so I can chase something I’ve always dreamed of…</p>

<p>Every time I fail the interview process I ask for feedback from the recruiter/HR/developer whom I talked to so I can learn from this. Because I can get feedback on how people view me in an interview situation, how was my performance, etc. I’m asking for it because I want to listen what they have to say. We are all adults in the industry (so I thought until recently) where we can tell each other our honest opinions.</p>

<p>One company and a group of people there let me down. They waited me for 2x2weeks at various stages in the process and got the ususal HR crap back:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>We carefully reviewed your skills and experience and although they are certainly 
noteworthy, we have decided that they do not closely match our needs at this time.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I asked for honest feedback but I guess I need to wait another 2 weeks on it. It’s ok to say that they think I’m a horrible guy, wouldn’t fit in. Or that I don’t have enough experience in a certain language. Just say so, and I can take that on, learn, and come back stronger for the next one.</p>
